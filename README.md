# Diplomatic Documents and Swiss Newspapers in 1914

This project gathers two data sets: (Diplomatic Documents of Switzerland)[http://dodis.ch/en/home] and [Le Temps Historical Archive](letempsarchives.ch) for year 1914. Our aim is to find occurrences appearing in both data sets and detect the events they have in common.
